In the shell or in a text editor, write a program that asks for the user to sign up for Programmer's Toolkit Monthly
Subscription Box. They must select level of membership they want. Each month is something different, t-shirts,
stickers, figurines, even programming books!
The levels are the following:

    Platinum
    Gold
    Silver
    Bronze
    Free Trial

Write an if statement that prints the cost for each of the level. Platinum is $60, each level below is 10 dollars
cheaper, and the free trial is free.
Submit your .py file.

#Creat variables: Platinum ($60), Gold ($50), Silver ($40), Bronze ($30), and Free Trial (free) and set their value
#Ask user to sing up for PTMSB (Programmer's Toolkit Monthly Subscription Box, ask which of the five levels
    #want to sign up for
#Take input from user and store in userSubLevel
#Compare userSubLevel to the five variables using if statements
    #Print the results: userSebLevel and its corasponding value
